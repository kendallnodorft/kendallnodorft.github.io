            <p class="paragraph-text justify-text">
                I'm a multi-passionate creator with a knack for bringing ideas to life. Whether it's designing eye-catching graphics, producing engaging podcasts, or experimenting with virtual reality, I love exploring new creative avenues. Iâ€™m currently at Integrative Emergency Services as a Marketing & Communications Coordinator.

                In my spare time, I love experimenting with new photography techniques and taking my beagle mix rescue, Oakley Ray, on hikes with me.
